# Search-Propeties
Javascript


I am trying to search throught the list of properties by address, zip ect.. 
The bedroom and bathromm search is where im having trouble, if I type 3 in the bedroom search field it pulls a list up with 2 and 3 bedroom homes. same with the bath. 

I thought it was because I was sending all search fiels through the same function so i did them all separately with no success. 

I'm not sure what im missing. 

And if you dont mind can you point me in the direction of doing this with out list.js.
I just can seem to wrap my mind around it. 

Thanx for anything you can do.
